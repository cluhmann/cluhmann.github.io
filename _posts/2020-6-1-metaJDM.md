title: Delay & Probability Discounting, also Theory
---

Current graduate student, Kelli Johnson, and former graduate student, [Michael Bixter](https://www.montclair.edu/profilepages/view_profile.php?username=bixterm), have published ([an article in *Judgement and Decision Making*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13421-017-0698-z)).  The paper reports a meta-analysis of published associations between preferences about delayed rewards and preferences about risk.  Results suggest an association that is consistently non-zero, but too weak to provide any support for existing theories.  You can read the article itself for more details.  But here, I wish to use this study to highlight a broader issue.
