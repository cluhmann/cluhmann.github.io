title: Paper about group DM, leadership
---

Former graduate student, [Michael Bixter](https://www.montclair.edu/profilepages/view_profile.php?username=bixterm), has gotten another dissertation-related paper published ([see previous](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13421-017-0698-z)). This paper investigates decision making in small groups, experimentally manipulating the status of select group members, and using some sophisticated structural equation modeling (small group research induces lots of annoying interdependencies which cause trouble for conventional analyses).
