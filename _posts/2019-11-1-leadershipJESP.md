title: Paper about group DM, leadership
---

Former graduate student [Michael Bixter](https://www.montclair.edu/profilepages/view_profile.php?username=bixterm) has gotten a manuscript accepted. The study investigates decision making in small groups, experimentally manipulating status of select group members and using some sophisticated structural equation modeling to analyse the resulting data (small group research induces lots of annoying interdependencies which cause trouble for conventional analyses).
