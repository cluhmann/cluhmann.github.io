The lab focuses on better understanding complex human behavior in a variety of contexts.  This work employs computational methods, both those typically labeled as machine learning and more conventional statistical inference.  These methods are used to develop theories of behavior and to analyze data sets.

* Tranmission of Information in Social Networks

** This project investigates the social transmission of information. The project employs a combination of behavioral experiments and agent-based computational simulations.

* Mechanisms Underlying Intertemporal Choice

** We are interested in how people make decisions involving trade-offs between value and time and are particular interested in a) understanding the mechanisms underlying such choices and b) how to most accurately predict how individual will resolve such tradeoffs.

* Learning

** We are interested in how people's choices are shaped by past choices and their outcomes.
